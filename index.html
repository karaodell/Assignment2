        <p>After years of experimentation, Dr. Odd determined that <br />the best remedy for a hangover is not drinking as much <br />the night before. When he woke with the worst hangover <br />of his life, he built a time machine and went back in time <br /> to convince himself not to drink so much. But instead of <br />convincing himself not to drink so much, he saw how <br /> much fun his past self was having, so he got drunk with him. <br />Both his selves woke up with hangovers. Failure. <br />He started to build a time machine. <br /> <q>Can you do it quieter?</q> his past self groaned. <br /><i>Laurence Simon</i></p>
